    The Fuse Community Day will take place the 14th of October in Paris. Feel free to sign up
    <a href="http://form.fusesource.com/forms/registerparis2010">here</a> and come to see Claus Ibsen, Guillaume Nodet, Rob Davies and myself presenting news about OSGI, SOA, Camel and ESB and some of our customers showing that in action (Lionel Cons - CERN, CÃ©dric Bourgeois - Atos Worldwide, Jean Folly-Kpodar - Osmocom).
