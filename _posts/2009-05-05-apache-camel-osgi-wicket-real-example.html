    I have finalized a first draft of the second part of my tutorial about Camel 2.0 / ServiceMix-Karaf / CXF / OSGI / Apache Wicket<br/><br/>The purpose of the second part was to explain how to design a simple project where different concepts like :<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>persistence (Hibernate/spring),</li>
        <li>routing (Apache Camel 2.0),</li>
        <li>mapping between CSV file and objects (using camel-bindy),</li>
        <li> webservices (Apache CXF - OSGI),</li>
        <li> osgi stuffs,</li>
        <li> packaging and deployment on Apache Karaf/ServiceMix OSGI server (features, PAX url),</li>
        <li> web application integration (Apache Wicket, PAX Web)</li>
    </ul>
    have been addressed.<br/><br/>The tutorial has been designed in 4 parts :<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li> Part 2a : real example, architecture, project setup, database creation</li>
        <li> Part 2b : transform projects in bundles</li>
        <li> Part 2c : add infrastructure and routing</li>
        <li> Part 2d : web and deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>and is available here :

            Just trying the latest code on https://github.com/cmoulliard/camel-osgi-servicemix-tutorial on Jan 2013 and almost runs other than openjpa issue of Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: There is no row for mapping &quot;org.fusesource.devoxx.reportincident.model.Incident&quot; in sequence table &quot;OPENJPA_SEQUENCE_TABLE&quot;, and the attempt to insert a row has apparently failed. Anyone any ideas? </div>

            Hi John,<br/><br/>Many thanks for your feedback. Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t test it on Spring DM server. As ServiceMix / Karaf uses the Spring Dynamic Modules with Felix or Equinox, then I don&#39;t need to test another platform.

            Hello,<br/>Thanks for the nice tutorial. I am starting a Wicket app at the moment in OSGI and your tutorial was definitely helpful for me.
            <br/>Though I did run into some issues while setting it all up. I am using Springsource DM server and after 3 days of struggling I think I almost have it working. I will write a small blog with the issues that I had.
            <br/><br/>Have you tried DM server yet? Can you share your experience on that as well? <br/>Thanks!

            It seems that the snapshot is not present for the moment on maven apache snapshot repository. You can build yourself (using maven) the bundle using the following address :<br/>http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/smx4/bundles/trunk/dom4j-1.6

            The example does not work:<br/>install -s mvn:org.apache.servicemix.bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.dom4j/1.6_2-SNAPSHOT<br/>could not be resolved
