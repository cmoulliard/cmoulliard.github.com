The goal of this interesting article is to help ESB users choose the right answer according to their needs, when confronted
with the most complex and diverse of ESB concepts: routing and orchestration.

Instead of abstract theorizing we will ground our efforts and reasoning in simple, real-world examples in
an attempt to fill the void between low-level routing and global, business service orchestration.
In other words: We will try to uncover how the different layers of routing and orchestration build up.

Even if the solution used to make the design is a ESB based on JBI specification --> Petals, the publication provides a clear presentation of the concepts and help the architect to choose.
