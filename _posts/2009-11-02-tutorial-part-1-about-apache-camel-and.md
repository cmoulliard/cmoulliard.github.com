Last friday, I have spend some times to update the part 1 of the Apache Camel tutotrial. This tutorial shows how you can easily and quickly build and deploy a small SOA project using Camel 2.0 top of Apache Felix Karaf 1.0.0

The second part of this tutorial will be upgraded soon and will include a new section about integration tests with Pax Exam.
