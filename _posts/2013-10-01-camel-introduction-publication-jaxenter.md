In June of this year 2013, I have published a first article about **[Apache Camel](http://jaxenter.com/tutorial-integrating-with-apache-camel-48211.html)** in the
Java Review **[jaxenter](http://jaxenter.com)**.

This article which is part of a series will introduce you core and more advanced features :

- How routing take place,
- Why Camel is called DSL/Fluent API,
- How type conversion is done between the objects,
- Data Formatting
- ...

about this Java Integration Framework.

The second part will cover data formatting between objects and formats currently supported by **[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/data-format.html)** but also mapping tools !
